              Agile Velocity may collect, use and share non-identifying information from Sites usage or other available sources, provided it does not individually identify users under applicable law. The company retains records including usage logs and click-throughs and may disclose such data to third parties in aggregate or deidentified form.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h2>Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>
            <p>
              Certain jurisdictions require lawful processing basis. Agile Velocity&apos;s lawful bases include consent, contract performance necessity, and legitimate interests of the company or third parties, provided such interests don&apos;t outweigh user rights and freedoms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legitimate interest examples include: complying with applicable law, protecting against security threats, administering business interests including improvements, and addressing customer relationship issues.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
              Agile Velocity retains personal information as long as necessary for fulfilling described purposes, unless restricted by applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
              The company identifies purposes before or at collection time. Collection is limited to information needed for identified purposes. Unless users consent or law requires/permits, personal information is used only for collection purposes or other purposes described at that time. Further consent is sought for processing personal information for different, incompatible purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Retention continues only as reasonably necessary for fulfilling collection purposes, including legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. Longer retention periods apply if complaints exist or litigation prospects appear reasonable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Retention periods consider: personal data amount, nature and sensitivity, unauthorized use/disclosure risks, processing purpose achievement through alternatives, and legal/regulatory/tax/accounting requirements.
