#### Decision Agility
Organizations must be nimble in their decision making to remain competitive and deliver products and services that customers demand. Central to this agility is the need for alignment--ensuring that all team members are moving in the same direction with clear objectives. This article explores how Product teams can create that alignment using objectives and key results, and how fast, aligned decisions accelerate value delivery, enhancing responsiveness to market needs.

#### Understanding Alignment and Objectives
Alignment refers to the cohesive functioning of various departments and teams within an organization, all working towards shared goals. Clear, measurable objectives are essential in achieving this [alignment](insights/blog/blog/organizational-alignment-will-make-break-agile-transformation). Objectives serve as a guiding light, helping teams understand how to contribute, providing necessary guardrails for sound decision making.

#### The Role of Decision Agility
Decision agility is the ability to make timely, informed decisions that can quickly adapt to changing circumstances. When teams are aligned with clear objectives, decision agility can transform from a desirable trait into a fundamental capability. Fast, aligned decisions not only reduce delays but also enable organizations to deliver value more efficiently and respond swiftly to market demands, thereby gaining a competitive edge.

There are three key components that are necessary to enable decision agility; Clear objectives, [decentralized decision making](/blog/centralized-vs-decentralized-agile-transformations) authority, and the right mix of skills and experience.

#### Set Objectives
Begin by involving relevant parties in the objective-setting process but keep the group small enough to discuss and debate effectively. This ensures that everyone has a voice, fostering a sense of ownership and commitment to the objectives while also ensuring the objectives are realistic and relevant.

Utilize the [OKR framework](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/okr) to create clear objectives. OKRs help organizations define what they want to achieve (Objectives) and how they will measure success (Key Results). This structure promotes [transparency](/blog/in-an-agile-transformation-transparency-is-to-empower-not-to-micromanage) and accountability, allowing teams to stay focused on delivering the right value at the right time.

If your organization hasn't defined OKRs in the past, be prepared to struggle together to define them. It can be surprisingly difficult to define objectives that are big enough to justify investment and funding, while being specific enough to inform trade-offs, action and measurable results.

Take the time to make your objectives clear and concise. Long descriptions of objectives tend to conflate ideas, muddy the water, and just aren't very inspiring. I'm reminded of a quote by Winston Churchill; "I'm going to make a long speech because I've not had the time to prepare a short one."

#### Empower Decision Making Authority
Decentralized decision making refers to a system where decision authority is distributed across multiple levels or departments within an organization, rather than being concentrated at a central point. This approach empowers individuals or smaller groups to make decisions relevant to their specific areas, promoting autonomy and responsiveness. By pushing decision making closer to those with the most relevant knowledge and context, decentralized systems can enhance adaptability and innovation. It also fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among participants, as they have direct control over decisions that affect their work or environment.

One of the key advantages of decentralized decision making is its ability to increase flexibility and [speed](insights/blog/strategies-for-shortening-time-to-market). Local decision makers can respond more quickly to changes in their specific circumstances without waiting for approval from a central authority. This can be particularly beneficial in dynamic environments where rapid adjustments are necessary or where different options or solutions need to be tested rapidly.

Decentralized systems do present some challenges such as inconsistencies between decisions made at different levels and the potential for coordination issues. To mitigate these risks, decentralized systems will require clear communication both up and down the organizational structure.

#### Communicate, Communicate, Communicate
Communication is key. Ensure that objectives, key results, decisions, and learning are all communicated clearly across the organization. Don't assume the message is crossing organizational boundaries such as from Product to IT, engage with stakeholders and validate the communication is effective. Use various channels to reinforce these messages and provide transparency, which helps maintain alignment and progress.

#### Foster a Culture of Flexibility
Encourage a culture where adaptability is valued. When teams understand the objectives and their importance, they can make informed decisions quickly, adjusting their actions based on real-time data and feedback. Celebrate when teams pivot in response to a challenge or problem and pull out a win. Highlight how the team went about making the change.

Be prepared for things to fail at times and don't punish teams or individuals for failure if an adapted plan doesn't work out. Use failures as learning opportunities. When things go exactly according to plan, there is no learning. Learning only happens in the gaps between "the plan" and what actually happened.

#### Hire Skilled and Experienced Product Managers
The role of the Product Manager is a difficult role that starts with a deep curiosity of the customer needs and motivations. It requires an ability to ask great questions, think strategically, take action, communicate clearly, inspire others, and provide laser focus on outcomes.

Over the years, I've seen many product management roles being filled based on tenure or subject matter expertise, without regard to some of the other key attributes needed for success. Take care to ensure your organization is filling the Product roles with people that have the right mix of skills and experience. This is especially true if you are in a large organization operating at scale. The Product Manager role is a big lever so leverage and scale the good qualities because the alternative is destructive.

#### Conclusion
Creating alignment with clear objectives and empowering skilled product managers with decision authority, is vital for fostering decision agility within your organization. By engaging stakeholders, defining OKRs, communicating effectively, and encouraging flexibility, you can enhance your organization's ability to make fast, aligned decisions. These swift decisions will accelerate value delivery and improve your competitive response to market demands. Assess your organizational capabilities, align your development and product teams, and make decision agility a core capability.
