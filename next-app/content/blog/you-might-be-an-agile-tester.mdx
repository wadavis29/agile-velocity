## You! Might Be an Agile Tester...
Here's my list of 12 reasons you migh be an Agile Tester:

- If you work in close proximity to Developers, you might be an Agile Tester.

- If you are test-infected.

- If you think automated testing is key in software development.

- If you invite yourself to meetings that you weren't invited to by someone else.

- If you are learning new skills and practicing continuous improvement along with your team.

- If you keep your team focused on delivering core functionality that has the highest business value.

- If you stay in touch with the big picture.

- If you and the Product Owner develop Acceptance Criteria for User Stories together.

- If you push automated tests to the lowest possible level to encourage fast feedback.

- If you are part of the "Power of Three" in functionality discussions.

- If you are a skilled exploratory tester discovering issues that could not be detected by automated tests.

- If you define non-functional requirements as User Stories, you might be an Agile Tester.
