Agile Velocity's [Path To Agility®](/path-to-agility) describes the activities and outcomes of implementing Agile and their impact on culture and business goals. We have taken repeatable patterns we have seen with our clients and combined them with organizational change models as seen in the Path to Agility® video below.

#### Summary:

Align - A critical first step, alignment occurs when leaders in an organization understand the business objectives that will be achieved with the transformation and communicates those objectives to the entire organization in a clear way.

Learn - Through training and guided practice via Agile transformation coaching, teams and leadership are equipped with new techniques and an understanding of how Agile works. Ownership of processes are transferred to an empowered team, and a culture of continuous improvement is put in place.

Predict- Teams solidify these newly learned practices and become more disciplined in applying them. This allows them to begin working in a predictable and iterative manner, enabling leaders to better forecast and to make informed business decisions.

Accelerate - Once the teams become disciplined and predictable, focus is shifted to organizational improvements to optimize across the full delivery cycle and shorten time-to-market.

Adapt - Agile begins to permeate throughout the organization. Teams are empowered, and leadership is able to respond to ever-changing market demands. During this stage, the organization achieves true business agility.

#### Getting Started On Your Organization's Path to Agility®

Before embarking on an Agile transformation, it's often helpful for leadership and sponsors to meet with experts to assess their "readiness" for an Agile transformation. For example, before any engagement, an Agile Velocity Coach meets with leaders within an organization to answer the following questions:

1. What is the organization struggling with specifically?

2. What business outcomes does the organization hope to achieve?

3. Do you have the talent and knowledge to implement Agile successfully?

4. How will you measure the success of the transformation?
