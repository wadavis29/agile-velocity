David Hawks, CST, CSC presented how to overcome 6 Agile Traps at the Keep Austin Agile conference.

## Presentation includes:

- Recognize 6 traps holding your organization back from being agile

- Realize how learning, short feedback cycles and developing a shared understanding allow teams to deliver more value

- Understand the importance of limiting work in process and getting to done in order to shorten cycle time

## The 6 Agile Traps:

- We make tough decisions too early and lock them in

- The teams don't have a shared understanding of their purpose

- Long/no feedback or validation cycles

- Drowning in a sea of opportunity

- Not getting to done

- Everything is important
