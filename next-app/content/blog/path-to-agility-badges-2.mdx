We're proud of our growing network of people dedicated to delivering better business outcomes through the [Path to Agility framework](/path-to-agility).

We created a set of badges for our Practitioners and Facilitators to use as a symbol of their dedication to helping organizations through their journey to agility.

When someone is certified in the Path to Agility, they are immersed in a practical and useful approach. Certified Practitioners and Facilitators help organizations know where they are and what they need to do on their journey of continual improvement. Using Path to Agility as a guide, organizations are able to identify the business results they are after and prioritize the Agile capabilities needed to achieve them.
