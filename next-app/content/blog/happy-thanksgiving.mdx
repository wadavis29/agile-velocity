We live in a world where companies deliver cookies fresh out of the oven and stress-relieving puppies. On the other hand, we live in a world that sadly reminds us every day that we really do have a lot to be thankful for.

Here are just a few of our reasons why we give thanks:

"I am thankful for the people in my life, including my co-workers and the people I get to meet through work. The world is full of lovely, fascinating people." -Doc List, Senior Director of Coaching and Training

"I'm thankful for my job. Also, I'm thankful for my trainer for helping me work off the Thanksgiving turkey." -Sara Abrams, Training Coordinator

"I'm thankful that I'm alive and also for cheese. I'm thankful for cheese." -Brett Simon, Wisconsin native and Tech & Agile Recruiter

"I too am thankful to have happy and healthy family and friends. I am also thankful to live in a vibrant and active city with lots of opportunities, optimism, resources, and friendly people."-David Croley, Senior Developer & Technical Player-Coach

"I am thankful for the health of my family and friends. I'm thankful for a bubbly, confident little girl who corrects my Spanish pronunciation. Also, I am thankful to live in a world that allows me to communicate my ideas with the push of a computer key."

"I am thankful for a happy and healthy family." - Jessica Bush, Business Operations Manager

"I am thankful for miracles: father beating cancer, friend's expected full recovery from a broken neck, and the love of my family (yes, that's a miracle)." - Mike Lepine, Director of Operations

"I am thankful for a passionate team that makes building a company fun and for a family which is supportive in my entrepreneur pursuit." - David Hawks, CEO

From all of us at Agile Velocity, Happy Thanksgiving!
