## Myths

Myth
Correct Action

The meeting is a status meeting for management (or the ScrumMaster)
The ScrumMaster purely serves as a facilitator on behalf of the team. Status to folks outside the team can be a secondary benefit, but it is not the primary purpose.

You only have to attend the daily scrum if you accomplished something towards the Sprint goal
As a team member, it is still important for you to engage in what the rest of the team is doing. It is also important for the rest of the team to understand why you are struggling to make progress.

It is the ScrumMaster's responsibility to monitor and adjust the plan
It is up to the team to own the plan and make any needed changes

Everyone provides status to the ScrumMaster
The team should provide status to each other

No one pays attention to each other's status (focusing on individual goals)
The team should focus on the team goal

Only the ScrumMaster identifies risks and mitigations
The whole team has responsibility for identifying risks and developing mitigation strategies

## Tools

![A swiss army knife - tools of the daily scrum](/images/blog/army-2186_1280-1024x682.jpg)

- Sprint Backlog - Allows the team to have visibility into all of the tasks remaining to achieve their sprint commitment

- Sprint Burndown Chart - Allows the team to quantify the amount of work remaining and if the team is on track

## Key Metrics

- How many days are left in the Sprint? This reinforces the urgency of a looming deadline

- How many points have been signed off by the Product Owner? This reinforces that it only matters if we complete stories (not just getting to code complete)

- How many hours are remaining compared to our target plan? This provides a view of how the team is progressing, most easily represented in a Sprint Burndown Chart.
