## Have you ever wondered if you are being utilized to the best of your abilities?

Or

Are you being held back from that role you feel you deserve?

Or

When is it the right time to make a proper exit from a company for career development?

In my experience talking to thousands of people, it is validated that everyone has had these questions at least once in their career and many think about it often but do not know the steps to take to manage it successfully and professionally.

What is the definition of insanity?

"Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result."

So what do you do?

## Here are a few key tips you can take to enhance and maximize your career success:

1- Talk openly to your boss or a leader in your organization about what advancement opportunities do they see for you and share your career goals. How do these align?

2- Ask for honest feedback about your constraints and what to do to improve your positioning for advancement.

3- Ask for expected timing around advancement opportunities and set goals to achieve these steps.

4- "Continue to develop your 'career capital' which is the way to truly determine your value to the organization," says Matt Roberts, President of [Agile Austin](http://www.agileaustin.org).

By being clear and honest with your manager/leader about your expectations as well as setting a formal plan with SMART goals even if the company doesn't have a formal succession plan you will set the right tone about what is important to you and where you want to be.

But remember you need to be open for honest feedback about what you could be good at vs something you may not. For ex: you may want to be a manager/leader but not everyone is cut out to be a leader.

Accepting the reality that you may not be cut out for who you truly want to be is a raw eye-opening experience. However, with a good career mentor who is invested in you as well as a sponsor inside your organization, you will be set for the greatest career success and personal satisfaction.
