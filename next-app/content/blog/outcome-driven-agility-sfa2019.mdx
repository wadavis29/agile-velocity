[Overcome Transformation Impediments with Outcome-Driven Agility - David Hawks - Southern Fried Agile 2019](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/zm7rZgq7w4snVx) from [Agile Velocity](https://www.slideshare.net/AgileVelocity1) As the rate of market disruption increases, it's now more important than ever that organizations gain the ability to respond, adapt, and thrive.
