At ProductCamp Austin, David Hawks presented Accelerating Learning and Overcoming the 6 Traps of Agile.

Accelerated learning is the key to unlocking the true potential of Agile. Often organizations implement the process aspects of agile/scrum but fail to find the key to unlocking its true potential. This presentation explores six traps agile teams fall into which prevent learning and how to overcome them. A potentially shippable product increment is the key and how to break work down, swarm, limit WIP, and get to done are imperatives. By accelerating learning we believe most organizations can deliver double the value in half the time.
