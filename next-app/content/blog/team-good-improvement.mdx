This is the second post in our [Scrum Assessment Series](/blog). A continuous improvement culture is the most important thing for a team to establish early.

## Where does the team land on the scale below?

 - Team does not care about performance

 - Team is aware of performance

 - Team discusses issues

 - Team identifies improvements

 - Team takes responsibility for improvements

 - Team is allowed slack to make improvements

 - Team benefits from improvements

 - Team continually seeks improvements

 - Improvements are recognized and appreciated by organization

Facilitating effective retrospectives on a frequent cadence is key. We highly recommend the book "Agile Retrospectives" by Esther Derby and Diana Larson to learn good techniques when facilitating your retrospectives.

## The Basics:

 - Did the whole team attend? Including the Scrum Master and Product Owner?

 - Are no managers are present? No stakeholders? (This is a good thing!)

 - Is there one after every sprint?

 - Is it timeboxed to roughly 1 hour for every sprint week?

 - Did the team discuss the facts from the Sprint? Burndown? Release Progress? Key Metrics?

## Good:

 - Are Retrospective action items tracked during the next Sprint for progress?

 - Do Retrospectives really lead to improvement?

 - Does everyone on the team engage in discussion?

 - Were the top issues discussed to reach the root cause?

 - Were 1-3 actionable goals set as the top priority?

 - Did the team discuss how they were going to ensure a change happens?

 - Did the team focus their time on what they can do better?

 - Did the team have open and honest communication?

 - Were everyone's ideas listened to?

 - Were real issues discussed?

## Awesome:

 - Do Product Owners and managers allow team slack to deliver improvements?

 - Does the team demonstrate the desire to continuously improve?

 - Does the team demonstrate the courage to try something radical?

 - Do changes lead to significant improvements?

 - Was there healthy conflict?

 - Were good things discussed? Did the team share appreciations?

 - Did the session foster shared team ownership?

 - Did the team demonstrate courage in their ideas for improvement?

## Ideas for Improvement:

 - Mix it up. Try something new. Don't let the format stagnate the discussion.

 - Start with appreciations to foster a culture of respect and trust.

 - Encourage the team to be courageous in their ideas.

 - Leverage Deep Democracy techniques to get everyone involved.

 - Define Team Agreements on how the team is going to handle conflict in a healthy way.

 - Don't just focus on process items, spend time on building team chemistry.

 - Start retrospectives with a [Prime Directive](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive) if ensuring positive thinking and reducing blaming is needed.
