We are excited to join Scaled Agile's Partner program. This worldwide network includes transformation and platform providers who help enterprises facilitate and accelerate business results through the adoption of the Scaled Agile Framework® (SAFe®). As the world's leading framework for enterprise agility, SAFe helps businesses address the significant challenges of developing and delivering high-quality software and systems in the shortest sustainable lead-time.

Agile Velocity's aim is to ensure companies always embark on their SAFe journey with a powerful, simple, and coherent transformation approach anchored to their unique business outcomes. Leveraging Agile Velocity's [Path to Agility](/path-to-agility)® alongside SAFe equips employees at every level to swiftly and accurately diagnose and resolve [root causes that derail or stall transformation momentum](services/agile-transformationwhite-paper-8-common-pitfalls-of-an-agile-transformation). Path to Agility produces quicker business results and lasting, durable agile capabilities.

"Our clients are clear. They need meaningful business results, and they don't want to get stuck in the chaos and resistance phase of a transformation,"Erik Cottrell, CEO Agile Velocity.
