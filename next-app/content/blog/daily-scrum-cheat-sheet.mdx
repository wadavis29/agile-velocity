## Daily Scrum Meeting Purpose

The goal of the Daily Scrum meeting is to synchronize and plan the team's work toward the Sprint Goal over the next day (until the next Daily Scrum) meeting.

## Attendees

- Delivery Team

- ScrumMaster (Owner)

- Product Owner (Optional, but preferred)

- Stakeholders (Optional)

## Agenda

- Make sure that the team starts on time. The ScrumMaster asks one of the team members to begin (if they do not take the initiative to start on their own).

- Each Delivery Team member should briefly (minute or less) update the rest of the team on three key points:

What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

- What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

- Add other needed discussion topics or issues to a parking lot list as they come up so that they don't interrupt the team quickly getting through an update from each of the team member.

- Ask the team how they are progressing toward the Sprint Goal.

- Once the normal Daily Scrum has ended, team members should stay around or plan to address items placed in the parking lot during the meeting

## Meeting Prerequisites/Preparation

Make sure that these are done before each meeting.

- Sprint Goal should be up-to-date and visible

- Current progress toward the Sprint commitment in the form of completed work, remaining work, and what is in progress

- Current Sprint Burndown chart indicating progress toward the Sprint Goal and ideal effort needed to reach the goal

## Guidelines

- Schedule a 15-minute block of time every day at the same time and location where the team can meet without being disrupted. This should happen close to the team's work area or where they can review a current sprint board.

- The Daily Scrum should ideally run by the development team, not the ScrumMaster. The ScrumMaster should ensure it happens regularly and is conducted well but may not need to even speak if the team is running it well

- The ScrumMaster should ensure that the meeting starts on time, keeps moving at a reasonable pace, and stays on goal

- The ScrumMaster is also responsible for making sure that identified impediments are recorded and addressed by someone

## Anti-patterns

These are patterns or behaviors that lead to inefficient or ineffective meetings. They should be addressed whenever found.

- Someone other than Development Team members speaking during the meeting

- Team members focus on the ScrumMaster and tend to report rather than inform and collaborate with the rest of the team

- Daily Scrum meeting doesn't start on time

- Meeting doesn't occur daily

- Daily Scrum meeting lasts longer that 15 minutes

- Impediments have never been identified

- Team doesn't follow up on issues/impediments

- Team doesn't adjust the plan to meet sprint goals
