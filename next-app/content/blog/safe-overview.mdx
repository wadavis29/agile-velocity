The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®) is a popular and widely adopted framework for scaling Agile practices across large organizations. Organizations must be able to respond quickly to market demands, align teams towards common goals, and continuously deliver value to customers. [SAFe offers a structured approach](/contact) to achieve these goals by expanding the principles of Agile and Lean across all levels of an organization.

### Why Adopt/Implement SAFe?
For large organizations, SAFe provides an unparalleled framework for scaling Agile. Its comprehensive approach ensures alignment between strategy and execution, offers transparency across all levels, and integrates Lean and Agile principles to deliver value faster.

Here are five compelling reasons to adopt SAFe, particularly when operating in large-scale environments.

#### 1. Scalability for Large Organizations
While commonly used frameworks like Scrum and Kanban are typically effective at the team level, SAFe is specifically designed to scale Agile practices across the entire organization. It coordinates multiple Agile teams working on interdependent and interconnected features, which is often a significant challenge for larger organizations. SAFe components such as [Agile Release Trains](/blog/what-is-agile-release-train) (ARTs) and Program Increments (PIs) allow organizations to plan and execute work more effectively across numerous teams, delivering value in a coordinated and predictable way.

#### 2. Alignment between Strategy and Execution
One of SAFe's key strengths is its ability to focus on aligning the organization's strategic goals with the work being done at the team level. It creates a direct connection between business strategy and team execution. At the Portfolio level, it aligns strategic initiatives with Program and Team level execution through a clear hierarchy, ensuring that everyone is working toward common goals.

#### 3. Focus on Lean Portfolio Management
SAFe integrates Lean principles into Portfolio Management, allowing for efficient decision making, lean budgeting, and faster value delivery. The [Lean Portfolio Management (LPM)](/contact) aspect of SAFe helps enterprises allocate resources to high-priority [value streams](/blog/value-stream-mapping), ensuring that investment is channeled into the areas that deliver the most value. It empowers leadership to optimize resources and investment for maximum return.

#### 4. Focus on Continuous Delivery and DevOps Integration
SAFe incorporates Lean-Agile principles and promotes a strong focus on continuous delivery, integrating DevOps practices for faster, more reliable releases. The Continuous Delivery Pipeline in SAFe enables organizations to automate testing, integration, and deployment, which results in reduced time-to-market and improved quality.

#### 5. Enables enterprise-wide Transparency and Visibility
Visibility is a common challenge in large enterprises. As an organization starts to scale, it becomes difficult to track progress, manage dependencies, or foresee potential roadblocks. SAFe solves this through its Portfolio and Program Kanban systems, visualizing the flow of work from the top of the organization to the individual teams. By offering a holistic view of all work in progress, SAFe enables better decision-making at the leadership level and more effective collaboration between teams.

## Key Components of SAFe
1. Lean-Agile Mindset

The foundation of SAFe is the Lean-Agile mindset, which combines the philosophies of Lean thinking and Agile principles. This mindset emphasizes delivering [maximum value while minimizing waste](/blog/lean-prioritization-matrix-or-bang-for-your-buck-matrix) and fostering continuous improvement, innovation, and respect for individuals

### 2. SAFe Core Values
SAFe is built on four core values that guide its practices and behaviors.

Alignment - Ensuring that all levels of the organization are working towards common goals.

Built-in Quality - Embedding quality practices in every stage of development.

Transparency - Promoting openness, trust, and honesty across all levels.

Program Execution - Focusing on delivering value consistently and effectively.

### 3. SAFe Principles
Take an economic view - Optimize decision-making on economic trade-offs.

Apply Systems Thinking - Understand the entire system, including its interdependencies.

Assume variability; preserve options - Encourage innovation by maintaining flexibility.

Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles - Deliver value iteratively while learning to adapt from each cycle.

Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems - Ensure progress is tied to real outcomes.

Visualize and limit Work in Progress (WIP) - Prevent bottlenecks and overload.

Apply cadence and synchronize with cross domain planning - Create incrementally and iteratively through cross-collaboration and regular planning.

Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers - Empower team members and encourage innovation.

Decentralize decision-making - Push decision-making closer to the team where the work is.

Organize around value - Structure teams around value streams for a continuous flow of value.

### 4. SAFe Configurations
SAFe offers [four different configurations](https://scaledagileframework.com/) to fit the size and complexity of the organization.

Essential SAFe - The most basic configuration, focusing on teams and programs

Large Solution SAFe - Addresses the needs of organizations building complex, multi-team systems

Portfolio SAFe - Aligns Portfolio Management and Strategic Planning with Agile execution

Full SAFe - A comprehensive solution that integrates all SAFe levels and practices

### 5. Agile Release Train (ART)
The Agile Release Train (ART) is the primary vehicle for delivering value in SAFe. It's a long-lived, self-organizing team of Agile teams (typically 5-12 teams) that work together to plan, develop and deliver features in a synchronized manner. ARTs operate within a fixed timebox, called a Program Increment (PI), which typically lasts for 8-12 weeks.

### 6. Program Increment (PI) Planning
[PI Planning](/blog/safe-pi-planning-series-pt1) is a critical event in SAFe where all the teams within the ART come together to plan and align their work for the upcoming Program Increment. It is a two-day event that occurs at the beginning of every PI and focuses on establishing common goals through synchronized planning and identifying dependencies and risks. Teams present the plan to the entire ART at the end of the two days and vote on their confidence level of achieving their goals. Once the teams are highly confident, they commit to the plan and close the planning with a retrospective on the two days with continuous improvement in mind.

### 7. Lean Portfolio Management (LPM)
Lean Portfolio Management (LPM) connects strategy to execution. LPM manages the flow of work at the portfolio level and ensures that funding is aligned with strategic priorities. The key elements of LPM include:

- Strategy and Investment Funding - Aligning investments with business strategy
- Agile Portfolio Operations - Coordinating Agile teams and operations
- Lean Governance - Ensuring financial and quality controls are in place

### 8. Value Streams
Value Streams are the primary construct for organizing teams and ARTs around the continuous flow of value. SAFe emphasizes organizing around value rather than functions, ensuring that teams are aligned with delivering products and services that provide value to customers.

### 9. Roles in SAFe
In addition to the general Agile roles of Scrum Master, Product Owner, and the Agile Team, SAFe introduces roles that ensure proper coordination across multiple teams, programs, and portfolios. Key roles include:

- Release Train Engineer (RTE) - Facilitates ART processes and events, helps remove ART level impediments, acts as the chief Scrum Master, andcoordinates dependencies across the ART.
- Product Manager - Focuses on delivering customer value by managing the product vision, roadmap, and prioritization.
- System Architect/Engineer - Provides technical guidance and ensures alignment with the overall system architecture.
- Business Owners - Ensure the ART delivers value in alignment with business objectives.

### 10. Continuous Delivery Pipeline (CDP)
The Continuous Delivery Pipeline in SAFe enables faster, more reliable delivery of value by automating and streamlining the development process. The CDP consists of:

- Continuous Exploration - Identifying and prioritizing new ideas/opportunities continuously.
- Continuous Integration - Building and testing solutions continuously.
- Continuous Deployment - Delivering the solutions into production environment continuously.
- Release on Demand - Releasing features to customers on demand.

### 11. DevOps and Built-in Quality
SAFe integrates DevOps practices to ensure continuous integration, testing, and deployment. Built-in quality ensures that quality practices such as, Test Automation, Continuous Integration, and ensuring technical excellence are embedded into every step of development, not just at the end.

### 12. Inspect and Adapt
The Inspect and Adapt (I&A) event is a critical event in SAFe that promotes continuous improvement across all levels of the organization. The purpose of the I&A event is to regularly inspect the results of a recently completed PI and adapt the practices, processes, and outcomes to drive continuous improvements. This aligns with SAFe's core principles of "Apply fast, integrated learning cycles". The I&A consists of three parts.

- PI System Demo - Teams demonstrate the fully integrated system that was developed during the Program Increment, including all new features and capabilities delivered across all Agile teams within the ART.
- Quantitative and Qualitative Measurement - Teams assess the success of the PI using both quantitative and qualitative measures. Metrics like Program Predictability Measure (PPM), [Flow Metrics](/insights/webinars), and qualitative feedback gathered from stakeholders, customers, and teams are shared during the I&A.
- Problem-Solving Workshop - The heart of the I&A event is the problem-solving workshop, where teams and stakeholders collaboratively identify root causes of any problems or challenges experienced during the PI. The workshop focuses on identifying most critical issues, brainstorming solutions, and developing actionable improvement plans.

### Challenges of SAFe
While SAFe offers many benefits, it also can be challenging in some aspects. Implementing SAFe requires experienced trainers and coaches, significant commitment, and cultural change. Organizations must be prepared for an initial investment in training and coaching to help teams transition to new ways of working. Additionally, maintaining alignment across a large organization with numerous teams can be challenging and requires strong leadership and coordination.

### Is SAFe Right for your Organization?
SAFe is a very powerful framework for large organizations that need to scale Agile practices across multiple teams and departments. However it may be overhead for smaller organizations with less than five teams and for those with simpler workflows. The key to success with SAFe lies in its flexibility, allowing organizations to tailor the framework to their specific needs and context within the four configurations.

### Conclusion
SAFe offers a comprehensive approach to scaling Agile, providing the tools, roles, and processes necessary for large organizations to deliver value at speed and scale. By fostering collaboration, continuous learning, and alignment across teams, SAFe helps organizations navigate the complexities of changing market conditions and achieve sustainable competitive advantage.
