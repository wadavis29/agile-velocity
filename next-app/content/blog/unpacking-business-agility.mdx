I recently had the pleasure of having a conversation with Pam Ashby, a strategist at the [Agile Business Consortium](https://www.agilebusiness.org/), to explore the world of Business Agility.

Business Agility is a topic that's been gaining momentum and for a good reason. In our fast-paced, ever-changing world, organizations must be able to adapt and, stay customer-centric to thrive.

Below are key takeaways from our discussion. See our [16-minute convo](https://youtu.be/24jwLorW6iE) for more context and information.

## What is Business Agility?

- Business Agility is the ability of organizations to adapt and respond to external changes swiftly.

- It ensures that businesses remain customer-centric, focusing on meeting customer needs effectively.

## Business Agility vs. Organizational Agility

- Business Agility emphasizes business outcomes and is a people-centric approach.

- Organizational Agility, on the other hand, focuses on the internal structures and connectivity within the organization.

## Embracing Business Agility Across the Organization

- Agility isn't limited to IT or software development--it can benefit all areas, including [HR](https://www.agilebusiness.org/agile-business-awards-conference/agility-in-hr.html), [finance/procurement](https://www.agilebusiness.org/agile-business-awards-conference/agility-in-finance.html), and [marketing](https://www.agilebusiness.org/agile-business-awards-conference/agility-in-marketing.html).
