[The Austin Business Journal named Agile Velocity](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2014/05/20/austins-best-places-to-work-for-2014.html) in the top ten of the best places to work in Austin for the micro companies category. Agile Velocity was named to the list for the first time, ranking #8 out of 20 micro companies. This award was announced at a luncheon hosted by the Austin Business Journal in Austin on June 26.

This is the first year Agile Velocity has been eligible for the Austin Business Journal award. Since its inception in 2011, Agile Velocity has grown from a single employee to over eleven with revenues increasing steadily each year. Agile Velocity began when founder, David Hawks noticed companies ineffectively building innovative software products with a lot of waste. With a background of building highly productive teams, David used these principles when establishing Agile Velocity. Austin Business Journal recognizes these elements as key to creating companies that are fun and desirable places to work.

Companies are evaluated on areas that include: benefits, job satisfaction, trust in leadership, the effectiveness of management, goal alignment, retention, and teamwork. Kevin Tougas, the Staffing Solutions Manager at Agile Velocity says, "Collaboration, innovation, and team empowerment are the foundations to what we teach and what we live by at Agile Velocity." Kim Phipps, the Marketing Manager at the company, said, "It is great to see Agile Velocity recognized locally. It is a company that truly practices what it teaches and is an amazingly fun place to work."

Agile Velocity is proud to represent micro-companies as an inspiring place to work. It looks forward to continued growth and sharing of these principles with customers and the Austin community.
