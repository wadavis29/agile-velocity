### 1. Establishing Clear Values to Guide Behavior

Establishing clear values is a cornerstone of building a culture that prioritizes continuous improvement. These values act as guiding principles that shape behaviors and decisions, ensuring that everyone in the organization is aligned with the goal of ongoing development and learning.

SMART goals act as stepping stones, breaking down the broader vision into manageable tasks that guide daily actions and decision-making.

Celebrating milestones is just as important as setting goals. It's a way to recognize the hard work of teams and individuals, reinforcing the value of their contributions to the organization's success. Acknowledging achievements, no matter how small, boosts morale and cements the continuous improvement culture. This recognition also reinforces the behaviors and practices that are conducive to continuous improvement, signaling what is valued within the organization.
