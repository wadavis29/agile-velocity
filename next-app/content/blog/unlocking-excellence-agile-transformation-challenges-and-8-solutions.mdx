For the past four years, we've been asking our [Path to Agility community members](/training/courses) the question: "What are your top Agile Transformation challenges in your organization"

We've collected over 560 data points from (sticky notes crowd-sourced during our classes) and ran them through a couple of large language model (LLM) tools ([Miro](https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiYlPOFnc6BAxVFjcIIHXZQCU0YABAAGgJqZg&gclid=CjwKCAjwyNSoBhA9EiwA5aYlb6lJjZ-Afc0omwGzg_hHpiT3lKbK9FKJfoAeZoiR1EOfIt8WIEogVhoCRQMQAvD_BwE&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESV-D2OsFqAhxuTEIc6LbvkN_ld4UzK80i6lE34-Y4ethgxNCjsUC-ByYVWeBHEUobkTe3HVBWH4zFekk3DS8FAujrAAHOckjaGETGpFDfi0FzateJieagDg&sig=AOD64_2DdPHbXa5C-uZ2BR4T3XPZ1aOHCA&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjyveuFnc6BAxVvkWoFHQY3Ab0Q0Qx6BAgLEAE) and ChatGPT) to analyze the data and generate some insights.

### Resistance to Change:

This is a persistent challenge across all four years. Participants consistently mention resistance from various levels of the organization.

### Lack of Leadership Buy-In/Support:

Leadership's commitment and support for Agile Transformation is a recurring theme, indicating its importance in driving change.

### Silos and Lack of Cross-Functional Collaboration:

Silos within organizations hinder Agile adoption and collaboration across teams is challenging.

### Misunderstanding of Agile:

Participants mention that not everyone in the organization understands Agile principles and practices, leading to confusion and misalignment.

### Culture and Mindset:

Changing the organizational culture and mindset is a continuous challenge. Participants mentioned the need for a shift in mindset toward Agile values.

### Metrics and Measurement:

Metrics have been a concern for multiple years, indicating the need for better ways to measure the impact and success of Agile Transformation.

### Funding Models:

Traditional budgeting and funding models have been mentioned as Agile Transformation challenges for several years, highlighting the need for a shift in financial practices.

### Role Ambiguity:

Participants in different years mention ambiguity in roles and responsibilities, which can hinder effective Agile implementation.

## Year-Specific Agile Transformation Challenges

We also prompted the AI-Bot (Miro's) to compare and contrast the response data, year over year:

- 2020: This year highlights challenges related to understanding the reasons for change, tracking progress, legacy systems, and a focus on semantics.
- 2021: Challenges related to finances, transparency, and skill gaps are emphasized, indicating the need for financial alignment and skill development.
- 2022: Challenges related to psychological safety, leadership change, and scaling are prominent in this year's responses.
- 2023: Challenges related to organizational structure, matrixed environments, and resource management are highlighted, showing the evolving nature of challenges.

## So What?

Overall, while there are common challenges across the years, each year also introduces new or evolving challenges, reflecting the changing dynamics and maturation of Agile Transformation within organizations. These responses underscore the complexity of Agile adoption and the need for ongoing effort and adaptation to overcome these challenges.

## Keys to Success

Alas, there is no silver bullet, but there are approaches that have been proven to be effective.

### Make Business Outcomes the Goal

By focusing on [business outcomes with effective measurements,](/blog/metrics-in-agile-how-to-measure-transformation?__hstc=115393177.38d40187b29f2a5b322e5bed4a3416d5.1709221259950.1711050943493.1711387591697.17&__hssc=115393177.13.1711387591697&__hsfp=2434429739) you can clearly communicate the value of Agile Transformation to employees (leaders, stakeholders, and individual contributors). When people understand how Agile practices contribute to achieving business goals, they are more likely to embrace change.

Communicating and demonstrating the connection between Agile practices and improved business outcomes can help leaders see the strategic importance of Agile. Doing so aligns Agile with their objectives, increasing their buy-in and support. [Implementing qualitative and quantitative measures](insights/blog/qualitative-and-quantitative-measures-infographic) will provide a balanced and holistic view of progress and impact.

### Leaders Lead the Change

When leaders actively participate in the Agile transformation and demonstrate their commitment to Agile principles, it sets a powerful example for the rest of the organization. Their visible leadership can motivate others to follow suit.

Leaders also play a crucial role in shaping organizational culture. When they lead the change by embodying Agile values and behaviors, it helps foster a more Agile-friendly culture.

### Shift from a Project to a Value-Driven Mindset

The focus from projects to value-driven products encourages cross-functional collaboration. In this structure, teams are aligned around delivering value to the customer continuously rather than working in isolated project-based structures. Also, emphasizing a product-focused value-driven mindset helps clarify that Agile is not just a project management framework but a holistic approach to delivering value to customers. Leveraging [flow metrics](/blog/how-to-use-flow-metrics-to-manage-the-madness-and-drive-action-video) at all levels will help drive visibility into opportunities to shorten the feedback loops.

### Create a Shared Language

Over the past decade, many people (especially those in technology) have had exposure in one way or another to "Agile." People will have different interpretations of terminology and the intent of key practices. Level-setting the group (through training and coaching) will enable better coordination and collaboration because everyone will be speaking the same language.

### Use a Structured Change Management Approach

A structured change management approach will help address resistance by acknowledging the natural reactions to change and providing support and communication throughout the transformation. P2A has incorporated organizational change patterns (e.g. [Kotter](https://www.kotterinc.com/methodology/8-steps/), [PROSCI](https://www.prosci.com/)) along with agile adoption patterns to guide your change journey.

### Shift Funding Models

Work with leaders to adapt funding models to better align with Agile principles, such as [Lean Portfolio Management](/insights/webinars?__hstc=115393177.38d40187b29f2a5b322e5bed4a3416d5.1709221259950.1711050943493.1711387591697.17&__hssc=115393177.13.1711387591697&__hsfp=2434429739) to fund value streams rather than projects. (Read more on [funding and budgeting to enable organizational agility at scale](insights/blog/beyond-budgeting-and-path-to-agility-enabling-organizational-agility-at-scale).)

### Involve the Entire Organization

By inviting and engaging groups that interact with the transforming teams and systems you improve organizational understanding behind the change. While this move broadens the scope of Agile beyond the initial group, it helps everyone understand that Agile principles are applicable to various aspects of the organization, including non-technical areas like HR, finance, and marketing. More importantly, extending Agile principles to other functions encourages collaboration and alignment across the entire organization.

### Build Internal Coaching Capacity

Developing internal Agile coaches who can provide guidance and support helps address the challenge of misunderstanding Agile. Coaches can educate teams and leaders on Agile principles and practices.

Internal coaches can also work on shifting the organization's culture and mindset by providing continuous support and coaching at all levels.
