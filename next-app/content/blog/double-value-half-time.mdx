David Hawks' presentation, Being Agile vs. Doing Agile: Deliver Double the Value in Half the Time, given at the PMI conference in Austin, September 2014.

## Being Agile:

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development processes harness change for customer's competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale.

- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project

- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhanced agility.

- Simplicity-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.

- The best architecture, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
