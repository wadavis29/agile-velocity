It's 2019, and Agile has officially transitioned from a software development methodology to a mindset designed for entire organizations. It truly doesn't matter what business department you highlight--all have similar problems at the root cause level. It's simple: many teams are burdened with more work than they can realistically get done. Agile can help teams get on track, own their outcomes, and work toward accomplishing clear goals and objectives.

In this miniseries, I'll highlight trends within four core departments and how leaders can implement Agile to eliminate bottlenecks and waste, increase throughput, and create predictable and empowered teams.

Without further adieu, let's jump in. In this blog, we're discussing Agile Marketing.

## Agile Marketing: Taming Content Craziness

Content may be king, but it also can be disruptive. Most organizations' marketing departments typically are responsible for a range of objectives, including:

- Content creation

- Events management

- Sales support

- Social marketing

- Advertising

- PR

Let's be honest: This is A LOT of work. Eliminating waste within these processes is crucial to achieving key goals. All work may seem like a high priority, but Agile helps marketing teams prioritize tasks that truly need to be completed now over those that can be deferred.

However, Agile Marketing is a different beast than Agile in technology. Software teams usually work on features, whereas marketing is multi-faceted--the same team of people is responsible for multiple funnels of deadline-driven work.

In spite of this, Agile works well in marketing. Why? Because companies, regardless of size, require high-performing, independent, and empowered teams--teams that are able to quickly adapt to change, collaborate effectively with other departments and achieve results. Additionally, since marketing is now MarTech, many proven and invaluable Agile software delivery solutions can play a greater role in marketing organizations that rely on technology.

There's a lot marketing can borrow from our experience in the technology sector. That's why we're seeing more Agile implementation within marketing departments and beyond.
