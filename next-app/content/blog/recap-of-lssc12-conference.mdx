I just returned from the Lean Software and Systems conference in Boston. There was a definite common thread around learning cultures and a focus on treating our industry as a set of scientific experiments. The heavy influence from the Lean Startup movement was prevalent. Here are some of my takeaways for those that were not able to attend.

## Steven Spear

- Greatness is achieved by increasing the pace of learning

## David Anderson

- Kanban Principles

Start with what you do now

- Agree to pursue incremental evolutionary change

- Initially respect current roles responsibilities and job titles

- Encourage acts of leadership at all levels from individual contributor to senior management

- Implement feedback mechanisms added

- Steps for converting to Kanban

- Understand sources of dissatisfaction

From viewpoint of internal and external

- Source of variability that cause dissatisfaction

- Demand and capability analysis

By work item type and class of service

- Model workflow

Understand the knowledge discovery process by type

- Kanban system design

- Visualization

- Roll out plan

## Steven Denning

- Dude's Law - David Hussman

Value - Why/How

- Focus on the Outcome

- The only valid purpose of a firm is to create a customer

Not create shareholder value

- Switch your focus from Outputs to Outcomes

- Customer Delight = Providing a continuous stream of value to customers and delivering it sooner

- The goal is to delight the customer. Everything else is a means to getting there

- Less is more. Aim for the simplest thing.

- Costs will come down because you will only focus on things that delight your customer

- Commands kill conversation

- Money kills inspiration

## Dominica DeGrandis - Kanban for IT Operations

- Need to get visibility to dependencies because they carry risk

- Design your SLA's into your board. Create timeline like tick marks across your in progress column and move items each day.

- Problems with board where there are names for swimlanes

- Standups are focused on individuals

- Perception of poor performance

- Limits Collaboration

- Focus on utilization

- Pigeon hole folks

- Bring visibility to skill levels of different skills required on team

- Make interrupts visible

- Institute the Goalie.

Handles small interrupts

- Rotates Weekly

- Expands Knowledge base

- Gain flexibility in team

- Make a policy on when the team should create a ticket for something (i.e. takes more than 4 hours)

## Jeff Patton

- Focus on Value

- Don't focus on maximizing the output, focus on maximizing the impact of the outcomes

- Think beyond the edges of the Kanban board

## Arne Roock and Markus Andrezak

- "Projects" are like waterfall containers that have planning, time constraints, focus, budget and purpose

- Replace projects with epics that align to strategic goal/ outcomes. Let the team work to achieve those outcomes

## Don Reinertsen

- Compared Software to Firefighting, "You don't just say this is a complex adaptive problem so we can't create a plan"

## Jim Benson

- Change happens in evolutionary leaps

- Kaizen is a status quo monster

## Misc

- Can run simulations through board http://www.focusedobjective.com/

- "Standard" is just the status quo written down
