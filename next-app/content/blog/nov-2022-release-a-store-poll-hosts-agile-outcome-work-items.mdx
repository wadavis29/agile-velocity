Path to Agility Navigator - NOV 2022 Release A

Hey Path to Agility Friends!

There are a couple of exciting new features to try out! 🎉 👏 We would love your feedback; feel free to read below for more details...

## I. Store Poll Hosts

Navigator can manage your default hosts for specific orgs, systems, and teams.

Navigator already gave you the ability to add a different host to a poll, which then emails that host. However, this new feature allows you to set the default host for any org, system, or team in the tool.

This means that poll hosts don't need to be re-added when there is a new assessment, streamlining the process.

## II. Agile Outcome Work Items

As we use the Work Items feature more, we realize that since not all work items are correlated to just one Agile Capability, we should provide a way to associate Work Items at a higher level.

Think of an example like this: a work item for "Ceremony Improvement" tied to the "Team Ownership" Agile Outcome.

We are proud to introduce the ability to associate work items with an Agile Outcome.

## III. Acceptance Criteria Tracking (BETA)

This is a way to track individual progress on Acceptance Criteria. It allows you to track which items need focus and understand the reason behind the Agile Capability level scores.

It would be daunting to comprehensively score all Acceptance Criteria. That being said, in areas where active work is happening coaches have wanted ways to help show incremental progress and to make subsequent iterative conversations as efficient as possible.

This feature is in BETA so that we can begin to assess how a feature like this will be used before making it a permanent part of the platform.

If you are interested in BETA testing this feature, please [let us know.](/contact)
