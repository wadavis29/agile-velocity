In this [Agile Uprising](http://www.agileuprising.com/) podcast, co-hosts Andy Cleff and Erik Cottrell sit down with David Marquet to discuss his [latest book, "Leadership is Language"](https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Language-Hidden-Power-Say/dp/073521753X/&tag=just00a-20). It's no secret we are huge fans of David Marquet's work, including his book, "Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders" so when we were presented with the opportunity to chat with him, it was a dream come true.

David, Erik, and Andy discuss six plays to change the way leaders show up, the impact that language has on our organizational culture, and ultimately on business outcomes:

- Control the clock, don't obey the clock

- Collaborate, don't coerce

- Commit, don't comply

- Complete, don't continue

- Improve, don't prove

- Connect, don't conform

Order ["Leadership Is Language: The Hidden Power of What You Say-and What You Don't"](https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Language-Hidden-Power-Say/dp/073521753X/&tag=just00a-20) to learn more about the six plays mentioned above.
