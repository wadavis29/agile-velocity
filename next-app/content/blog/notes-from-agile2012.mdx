Last month I attended the Agile2012 Conference, where the core themes were Agile Organization Transformation and thoughts challenging the effectiveness of the currently defined Product Owner role.

## Agile Organization Transformation

- We are failing at agile adoption 3 out of 5 times - Sahota

- Do you have a deliberate plan on how you are going to change the organizational culture? - Sahota

- The only thing of real importance that leader sod is to create and manage culture - Edgar Schein

- Culture = how do we do things around here to succeed - Sahota

- Lots of talk about Being Agile vs. Doing Agile

Doing - Process, Tools, Instructions, Ceremonies

- Being - Values, team reaction, understanding, adaptability, leadership everywhere, failure is ok

- Wait until there is friction before you define new roles or processes

- Navy seals have teams of 4 and some argue for 5, but everyone agrees 6+ is too much as it creates to much communication overhead

- Bad interactions pack 5x the wallop of good interactions

- Bad is stronger than good. Bad behavior is stronger, longer-lasting, more contagious and more difficult to stop than good

- [Spiral Dynamics](http://submit2012.agilealliance.org/files/session_pdfs/Cultural%20change%20with%20Spiral%20Dynamics_A2012.pdf) was an interesting tool to use when trying to measure team maturity

## Product Owner Role Change?

- Most companies are drowning in a sea of opportunity - Rubin

- Interesting dimensions that affect what type of PO and process work - Patton

Are your users internal or external?

- Do your users have control over the use of your product?

- Velocity isn't a measure of value. The outcome is where we need to measure if we are delivering value. Are we changing the world? - Patton

- Found a Jeff Patton presentation where he talked about the Underpants gnomes. He is now one of my new favorite thought leaders.

- What if the PO role was defined as a servant to the team to help facilitate bringing the customer perspective closer to the team? - Patton

- MVPe = minimal viable product experiment. Smallest viable experiment to validate a product hypothesis - Patton

- We need to be focused on learning about outcomes - Patton

- David Hussman

The product backlog is too much about delivery and not discovery

- The Product Owner is structured as a singular failure which needs to be distributed

- We need a group of people speaking with one voice

- Stories often miss the real value

- Focus on User-centered user experiences over user stories and product backlog

- Once you are not bad at delivering, then you need to start focusing on delivering the right thing

- Discovering through mapping

Name the goal

- List a few examples (simple complex)

- Walk a day in the life of each activity

- Back up and resell the experience

- The problem is that documentation isn't read. It doesn't allow us to get interaction and discovery

- Can everyone on the team tell the story?

- Leave the map whole. The map gets you discovery and then you create the delivery stories underneath which may duplicate.

- Story maps show examples

- Examples are a type of test

- Story maps can drive testing

- A test would be one scenario of a path through the story map

- Story maps foster product thinking, product learning (MVP) thin sliced product discovery

- [Pragmatic bookshelf Videos](http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dhcag/cutting-an-agile-groove) $50 for 6 hours of content

- When you are unclear, say " can you give me an example?"

## Misc.

- Played a great game where you start a story and each person in the circle adds to it

1st round you start your statement with "yes, but"

- 2nd round - "yes, and"

- 3rd round - "yes, and because of that"

- Try it and see which one takes the team into a very negative place and which one creates a much more positive and constructive discussion

- High trust companies outperform low trust companies by 300% - Pixton
