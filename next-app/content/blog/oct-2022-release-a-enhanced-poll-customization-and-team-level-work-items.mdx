Path to Agility Navigator - OCT 2022 Release A

Hey Path to Agility Friends!

Here is a little video tour of some of our new features. 🎉 Feel free to read below for more details...

## I. Advanced Poll Filtering: Agile Capabilities

 Include only the Agile Capabilities that matter to you.

You might be familiar with the ability we have to restrict the scope of polls based on Stage and Level. Well, the newAdvanced Capability Poll Filtering is the next evolution based on feedback directly from our users.

Tailor the list of capabilities assessed based on prioritized Outcomes or just hand-pick the list of Agile Capabilities you are including to increase validity, reduce survey fatigue and connect your assessment efforts to real action.

We would love to have feedback on this first iteration and continue enhancing it to best meet your needs-leave a comment below!

## II. Team Level Kanban for Work Items

Transparency and accountability for transformation progress at an individual team level.

Our journey with Navigator started with a focus on Agile Leadership Teams and high-level transformation coaching. A theme we are working on currently is to make the software more accessible for individual teams. As such, we have added the ability for work items to be tied to a particular team, system, or organization within the system.

## III. Add Work Items while in a Poll

Discuss and track actions while you poll.

Another popular request. Adding work items is possible to do from the map, from the assessments, from the progress area, or from the work items area. It is only logical the next step was to enable this functionality within the poll.
