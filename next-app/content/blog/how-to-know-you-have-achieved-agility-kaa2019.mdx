In this workshop at Keep Austin Agile, David Hawks discussed the importance of being outcome vs. practice-driven and how that will lead to sustained impact and organizational agility. Attendees worked together to break down desired business outcomes into core capabilities to help them determine where their organization is and provide them with action items to focus on next.

Key Takeaways:

- An Agile transformation is an organization-wide change

- Descale to reduce complexity in the system and help an organization scale

- Outcome-driven organizational agility frames an Agile transformation based on the business outcomes an organization is trying to achieve
