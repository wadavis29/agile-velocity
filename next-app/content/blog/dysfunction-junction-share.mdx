We need your help! Agile Velocity is putting together a video about Scrum dysfunction and are looking for input on what dysfunctions to cover and what tips to offer.

Here are some dysfunctions we see to get the creative juices flowing:

DYSFUNCTION: Someone starts a side discussion while others are talking

DYSFUNCTION: Someone rambles on until they're asked to move on

And here are some tips and tricks we like to use:

TIP: Have a talking ball that the team passes around

TIP: Create a rule to keep long talkers to a minimum like the ELMO rule (Enough Let's Move On)

What problems has your team encountered? How did you solve it? What worked, what didn't? Please share your dysfunctions and tips with us below in the comments.
