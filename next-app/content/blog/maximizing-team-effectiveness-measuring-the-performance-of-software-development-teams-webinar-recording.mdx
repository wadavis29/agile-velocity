 During the webinar, we took a poll on the funniest and worst team metrics you've ever seen or heard of. Here's the list of answers... 🤣☠️

- Lines of code
- Individual user story point count - how much a developer is able to do over another one. Developers would compare that against each other. Developers have different skills and work effort is different
- Velocity-based coupled with a 2-page guide for exactly how story points were to precisely be defined
- 100% code coverage target
- Number of packages modified
- Most Jira tickets completed per sprint. Team counts were publicly compared. Suddenly Jira counts quadrupled but no more work was completed
- Number of defects found in QA phase
- CEO heard term "capacity" and viewed it like a Hefty trash bag... that you could stuff and stuff it, and it'll stretch accordingly to hold ALL needs. Nope; quantity can have a quality all its own
