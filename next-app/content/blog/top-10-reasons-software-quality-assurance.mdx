## Software Quality Assurance, Why I love it:

![Vintage still life with testing and quality assurance themed items](/images/blog/still-life-838362_1280-1024x682.jpg)

### #10

I love quality assurance because every bug I find is one that was not found by the customer.

### #9

There is always more to learn about testing techniques and tools.

### #8

Being part of a team that delivers a quality product gives me great pride.

### #7

Running an automated UI test run kind of feels like the computer is doing your work while you sit and watch.

### #6

I still get to program (automated tests).

### #5

I like working closely with product visionaries. By this, I mean both Product Management as well as software architects and developers.

### #4

The software does what it should and doesn't do what it shouldn't. That's just how I think.

### #3

Preventing defects is more fun than finding them and writing them up in a bug tracking system.

### #2

I can make my team members laugh simply by creating goofy test data.

### And the #1 Reason

Because quality is something that everyone wants!
