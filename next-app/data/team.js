    fullBio: `David Hawks founded Agile Velocity in 2010 with a vision to help organizations achieve genuine business agility, not just adopt practices, but transform how they deliver value.

As a Certified Enterprise Coach (CEC) through the Scrum Alliance, David brings the ability to guide executive teams on transformation strategy, help leaders align their organizations to optimize value delivery, and identify areas to remove waste from the system of work.

His approach centers on tangible business outcomes rather than agile for agile's sake. This philosophy led to the development of the Path to Agility® framework, which has guided hundreds of organizations through successful transformations.

David holds a Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Information Systems from the University of Texas at Austin. When not helping organizations transform, he enjoys swimming, running, boating, and supporting his alma mater's athletic programs.`,
