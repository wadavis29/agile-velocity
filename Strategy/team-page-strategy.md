# Team Page Strategy: Quality Over Quantity Positioning

## The Client's Concern
> "I don't know that I want to publicize our FTE team size on a meet the team page. Open to discussion but I think it hurts us on these enterprise opportunities."

## The Defensible Position

### Why Boutique Is Actually an Enterprise Advantage

Enterprise clients often default to larger consultancies, but research shows boutique firms win when they reframe the conversation around **what actually matters for transformation success**:

**1. The Bait-and-Switch Problem with Large Firms**
> "One of the major turn-offs with Big 4 firms is the concern that the key players who tend to sell you on a project don't pass it off to their subordinates." — DevSquad

Large consultancies sell with senior partners, then staff with junior consultants learning on the client's dime. Agile Velocity's model ensures the experts who design the engagement are the ones who deliver it.

**2. Senior-Led, Not Junior-Staffed**
> "Boutique firms typically have fewer junior people and a higher percentage of experienced, senior consultants. This creates a significant competitive advantage." — Consulting Success

Your team averages 20+ years experience per consultant. That's not something to hide—it's a differentiator.

**3. Focused Attention vs. One of 100 Accounts**
Enterprise clients at large consultancies compete for attention. At Agile Velocity, every client gets focused, senior-level engagement throughout their transformation.

**4. Scalability Through Network, Not Headcount**
Your 100+ partner network provides scalability without diluting expertise. When engagements need additional capacity, you can tap certified practitioners who meet your quality bar.

## The Messaging Framework

### Instead of Hiding Team Size, Reframe It

| DON'T Say | DO Say |
|-----------|--------|
| "We have 9 people" | "You work directly with senior practitioners" |
| "Small but mighty" | "Senior-led, partner-delivered" |
| "Boutique firm" | "Focused transformation consultancy" |
| Nothing about scale | "Scalable through our certified partner network" |

### Key Proof Points to Lead With
- **100+ years combined enterprise experience** (aggregate your team's experience)
- **100+ successful transformations** (outcomes, not headcount)
- **30+ certifications** across SAFe, Scrum Alliance, ICAgile (quality bar)
- **Fortune 500 clients** across 8+ industries (credibility)
- **100+ active partners** in global network (scalability)
- **Same team from start to finish** (no handoffs to juniors)

## Implementation Plan

### Structural Changes to Team Page

**Current Structure (Exposes Headcount):**
1. Hero
2. Leadership (4 cards)
3. Business Agility Consultants (4 cards)
4. Client Success (1 card)
5. Join Our Team CTA
6. Ready to Work Together CTA

**New Structure (Emphasizes Expertise):**
1. **Hero** — Updated messaging about senior-led expertise
2. **Why Our Model** — Brief section explaining the advantage of working with senior practitioners
3. **Leadership** — Keep 4 partners (enterprise clients expect to see leadership)
4. **Our Practitioners** — Replace individual cards with expertise-focused presentation
5. **Our Network** — New section highlighting 100+ partner network for scalability
6. **Ready to Work Together** — Keep final CTA

### Specific Changes

#### 1. Update Hero Copy
**Current:**
> "Experienced practitioners who've built products, led transformations, and helped organizations achieve breakthrough results."

**New:**
> "Senior practitioners who deliver your transformation—not junior consultants learning on your project. The partners who design your engagement are the ones who lead it."

#### 2. Add "Why Our Model Works" Section
New section after hero, before leadership:

**Headline:** "Senior-Led. Partner-Delivered."

**Content:**
> Large consultancies sell with their best people, then staff with whoever's available. We take a different approach.
>
> Every Agile Velocity engagement is led by senior practitioners with 15-25 years of enterprise transformation experience. The partners who scope your initiative are the ones who guide it. No handoffs. No junior staff learning on your dime.
>
> **100+ years combined experience. 100+ successful transformations. The same team from start to finish.**

#### 3. Restructure Practitioners Section
**Option A: Expertise Cards (Recommended)**
Replace individual consultant cards with capability/expertise cards:
- Enterprise Transformation Strategy
- Leadership & Executive Coaching
- SAFe & Scaled Agile
- Portfolio & Value Stream Management
- Team Coaching & Training

Each card shows: Area of expertise, collective certifications, industries served.
Leadership remains as individual cards (enterprise expects this).

**Option B: Abbreviated Team Display**
Keep individual cards but remove the explicit section counts. Show consultants in a more condensed format (smaller cards, no explicit "Business Agility Consultants" header that invites counting).

#### 4. Add "Our Network" Section
**Headline:** "Scalable Expertise Through Our Partner Network"

**Content:**
> When your transformation needs additional capacity, we don't scramble to hire. We tap our global network of 100+ certified practitioners—each vetted against our quality standards and trained in Path to Agility®.
>
> This means enterprise-scale capability without enterprise-scale cost or the quality dilution that comes with rapid staffing.

**Include:**
- "100+ Active Partners" stat
- "Path to Agility Certified" badge
- Note about vetting requirements (2+ years experience, certification required)

#### 5. Update "Join Our Team" CTA
Reframe from "we're hiring" (which implies small) to "join our network":

**Current:** "We're always looking for experienced practitioners..."

**New:** "Join Our Network of Practitioners"
> Are you a senior agile practitioner with enterprise transformation experience? We're always interested in connecting with professionals who share our commitment to outcomes-driven transformation.

## Content Inventory (What We Keep, Cut, Change)

### KEEP
- All leadership bios and cards (enterprise clients expect this)
- Individual profile pages (these are valuable for SEO and credibility)
- Final CTA section

### CUT
- Explicit section headers that invite counting ("Business Agility Consultants")
- Individual consultant cards on main team page (move to dedicated section or expertise view)
- "Client Success" as separate section (fold Gina into leadership or operations)

### CHANGE
- Hero copy → senior-led positioning
- Page structure → lead with value prop, not org chart
- Practitioners display → expertise-focused, not headcount-focused
- Add network section for scalability messaging

## Handling the Conversation with Prospects

When enterprise prospects ask "How big is your team?":

**Weak Response:** "We have 9 full-time consultants..."

**Strong Response:**
> "Our core team includes senior practitioners with 15-25 years of enterprise transformation experience each. For larger engagements, we scale through our network of 100+ certified partners. What matters is that the senior people who design your transformation are the ones who deliver it—no bait-and-switch to junior staff."

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Prospects still discover team size through LinkedIn
**Mitigation:** The goal isn't to hide the number—it's to not lead with it, and to reframe small size as intentional and advantageous.

**Risk:** Removing consultant cards feels like hiding something
**Mitigation:** Keep detailed individual profile pages accessible. The main team page becomes a "why work with us" page; individual bios remain available for those who want depth.

**Risk:** Enterprise RFPs ask for team size/staffing plan
**Mitigation:** In formal proposals, include full team plus network capacity. The website isn't an RFP—it's a first impression that should emphasize value, not staffing tables.

## Success Metrics

After implementation, evaluate:
1. Are enterprise prospects still engaging after visiting team page?
2. Does sales team feel confident directing prospects to the page?
3. Does the messaging align with how the team talks about themselves in sales calls?
