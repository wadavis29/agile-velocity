## Implementation Notes

### Navigation Structure

- **Top nav order:**  
  Outcomes | What’s In Your Way? | Path to Agility (dropdown: Framework, Navigator, Partner, Trial) | Training | Insights | About | Let’s Talk (CTA) | [Navigator Login] (utility external link)

- **Path to Agility Framework**  
  - `/path-to-agility/`: Framework overview, model, methodology; "what is it?"  
  - `/path-to-agility/navigator/`: Software (Navigator) page (product, features, benefits)  
  - Knowledgebase is an external documentation link—NOT in main nav, only referenced from Navigator/support pages.

- **“What’s In Your Way?”**  
  - Limit top-level nav to the final 8 obstacles only—no deeper subpages.
  - Each obstacle page can include sub-sections for "support work," "ROI/metrics," etc. (not nav links).
  - *AI & Modernization* should be visually distinct (badge or menu highlight).

- **Outcomes:**  
  - Use benefit-driven user labels, reference Path to Agility language internally if helpful.

- **Navigator Login:**  
  - Always an external link: https://navigator.pathtoagility.com/ (never a site page).

- **Knowledgebase:**  
  - Linked from support/FAQ/product pages.
  - Not present in top navigation.

- **Footer:**  
  - Group links by function: Company, What We Do, Resources, Platform, Legal.
  - Repeat Navigator Login and Request a Trial, but not Knowledgebase.

- **CTAs:**  
  - Primary: “Let’s Talk” (Contact)
  - Secondary: “Request a Trial” (Path to Agility/Navigator pages), “Explore Framework” (Path to Agility)

- **SEO/Redirects:**  
  - Retain/redirect all published pages listed in sitemaps.
  - Use H2/FAQ for extra search demand under each main Outcome/Obstacle.

- **Labels and Terminology:**  
  - For nav/sections, use plain English, buyer-centric labels.
  - Outcomes = P2A outcomes, each described using clear benefits.
  - “What’s In Your Way?” = Buyer language—one page per major challenge/pain; no navigation clutter.

---

### Other Practical Notes

- **No login page—Navigator Login is a direct external link from nav/footer/utility UI only.**
- **Only 8 “What’s In Your Way?” obstacles to avoid decision fatigue; each page can have sub-sections for as many pain points as needed.**
- **“Path to Agility” and “Navigator” are clearly separated.**
- **Knowledge base is available (support/external) and NOT in primary or utility navigation.**
- **Never overlap Outcome pages and Obstacle pages in search intent—FAQ/sub-sections cover adjacent queries inside the most relevant page.**
