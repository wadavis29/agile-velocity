**Phillip Finucane** — *CareCentrix*

> Agile Velocity was a strong partner, and I believe their contributions have positioned our teams to continue evolving with greater agility and self-sufficiency.

---

**Phillip Finucane** — *CareCentrix*

> Agile Velocity began by delivering in-depth Agile training tailored to both our software and teams and our executive leadership (C-staff), setting a strong foundation for the journey ahead. From there, they transitioned into embedded coaching, working directly with our teams through the first four sprints to help them adopt and internalize Agile practices. Their guidance around ceremonies, team dynamics, and problem-solving was particularly effective in helping teams build confidence and autonomy.

---

**Phillip Finucane** — *CareCentrix*

> When we were about to start our Agile Transformation, we knew we wanted training and coaching to help get things off on the right foot. We spoke to a few different companies and eventually selected Agile Velocity because they were nimble and shared our vision for what a successful transformation should look like.

---

*Executive Assistant to CIO*

> My team and I very much enjoyed working with Agile Velocity for our Agile training. Everyone was focused on the outcome and helpful in providing all the information we needed to be successful. We will definitely look to Agile Velocity for our future training needs.

---

*Agile Transformation Manager / Enterprise Agile Coach / Process Lead*

> Agile Velocity consistently listened to our feedback and proactively addressed it — from adapting the materials to add more value to our teams to allocating additional time outside of the classroom to provide practical on-hand support to our teams.

---

*Agile Transformation Manager / Enterprise Agile Coach / Process Lead*

> The Agile Velocity team organized and managed the training schedules, ensured timely delivery of all materials, and coordinated coach assignments. When we required additional classes, they even brought in external coaches to meet our needs.

---

*Director of Insights & Operations*

> I've been in the technology and project management business for over 20 years. In those years I saw the good, bad and ugly skill levels of Customer Relationship Management. Our Agile Velocity coach was not only good…but great in leading their organization to deliver on and beyond expectations. Teams don't deliver consistently like this unless they are led to do so. She led! She has the right passion for her customers and the teams she influenced to get the job done well.

---

*Sr Agile Coach, Technology*

> The Agile Velocity team has taken a chaotic and disordered process and has created a wonderful, smooth experience for our cohorts. I know it takes a lot of work to make it look so easy. I appreciate the way they have handled the class communications and updates. It's been very clear when I need to take action.

---

*Manager, Technology*

> The Agile Velocity team adeptly navigates various goals and viewpoints, showcasing their exceptional event planning skills. They remain calm and collected, even under pressure, making everyone feel at home.

---

*Manager, Technology*

> The Agile Velocity coaches went above and beyond to help me register my POD for a Scrum class last minute. I appreciate the help and flexibility. They are awesome to work with.

---

*Agile Coach*

> The Agile Velocity coaches are easily approachable and listen well. They truly understand the importance of detailed preparation and the work involved to deliver successfully.

---

*Agile Coach*

> I love working with the Agile Velocity coaches because they are extremely organized. They prepare well ahead of the target date, send out reminders, and write checklists/procedures on how to perform their responsibilities.

---

*Director IT Transformation*

> There are plenty of other areas that the Agile Velocity coaches supported us in order to make sure our engagement was successful. They really did a fantastic job of keeping the Agile Velocity "engine" going!

---

*Director IT Transformation*

> The Agile Velocity team stepped up and took the lead on developing our Agile training program when another team member wasn't able to. They not only put the catalog together, but they also advised on the cadence, audience and objective of each class. They also supported the trainers and the classes by ensuring all supplies were ordered and delivered on time for each class.

---

*Director IT Transformation*

> The Agile Velocity team has great communication skills, both written and verbal. They are always responsive and follow up on actions in a timely manner. They work autonomously and proactively, but escalate issues as appropriate. Agile Velocity thinks outside the box and finds creative solutions to issues we've had to work through as a team.

---

*Director IT Transformation*

> I've had the opportunity to work with the Agile Velocity team over the past year in my role as Director of IT Transformation. I've very much appreciated their partnership and the value they've added to our team.

---

**Jeanette Ward** — *President & CEO, Texas Mutual Insurance Company*

> We accelerated through our transition with Agile Velocity's help. The Path to Agility was crucial to our journey because it focused on outcomes, strengthened our capabilities, and became an integral part of our improvement mindset.

---

**Mitratech**

> Before working with Agile Velocity we never finished a sprint. We are now completing sprints consistently and pulling in additional work.

---

**Nicole Tanzillo** — *Co-founder & COO Ceresa*

> [The best part about our transformation] once we got out of the bottom of the change curve, the energy fundamentally changed. There's something about having things on the wall, having standups, and operating differently that they were able to take ownership in a way they never had the context to do well before. It was exciting and felt good to be around.

---

**Amy Green-Hinojosa** — *Vice President of Enterprise Program Management, Texas Mutual Insurance Company*

> Our culture has changed significantly. We are a good place to work. We were voted one of the best places to work in Texas. But within IT, we were very siloed. Teams didn't interact with each other, and we didn't interact as much with our onsite business customers. But, now [with Agile Velocity] what you see is that buzz and energy. Everybody is really focused on collaboration and tackling things together.

---

**Kristen Raleigh**

> I like that it wasn't just sitting for 8 hours. We were very engaged.

---

> Both the instructors were very informative and kept everyone in tune and interactive all the time. Overall, they're just a great company. I learned way more in training and am now more equipped with the right tools to tell [my team] how to properly use the methodology that no YouTube video could ever teach me.

---

**Marlon Herron**

> Loved it. Can't wait to get back to the office and start championing [Agile].

---

*Associate Systems Analyst*

> The best part of the class was the hands-on experiment after each module. This really reinforces the materials learned.

---

*Attendee*

> The class was pretty polished. Nothing is lacking really. The lecture was done in an exceptionally informative and engaging way.

---

*Executive Editor*

> Bravo on addressing the core principles of Agile to an audience with different levels of experience in an organization!

---

**Philip Padel** — *Senior Scrum Master*

> The virtual format was INCREDIBLE. I encourage you to continue offering virtual training.

---

> I really liked the "informal-ness" of this class. I was worried about being attentive or learning as much as an in-person class, but I thought it was very well done. The trainer didn't seem to have any issue and acted like he does these virtual classes all the time.

---

> I thought the virtual format was great. Other than some minor technical issues, it was good. Very surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

---

> [Agile Velocity trainers] clearly have extensive real-world experience and always tie things back to the essential value of agile rather than just covering the superficial practices.

---

*Private Training Client*

> I appreciate the details and the exercises we did. I also like the recurring examples that it is okay to say 'No' and be realistic about stakeholder asks.

---

*Web Developer, VA*

> Loved the activities that showed us basic concepts, like the ballpoint exercise and the name game.

---

*Reporting Liaison, NYC*

> I really enjoyed the variety of exercises. They were tons of fun and made the theories and learning memorable and real. Instructors had great energy and humor.

---

**Katie Morris** — *Director of IT Transformations for Southwest Airlines*

> I was impressed with Agile Velocity's ability to quickly come up to speed, gain trust from the Southwest Teams and begin to partner in driving our transformation. They used the Path to Agility which drove alignment on goals, necessary actions, and focus areas as well as helped us track and visualize maturity. Their coaching enabled our teams to pivot and re-prioritize work in a quick and organized manner.

---

> Great Class! Good content with relevant real-life examples used, good assignments, and good pace of class.

---

**Rob Garcia**

> The course was an excellent way to spend 2 days. The material was very relevant and provided in a way that focused on practical application. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who was looking to understand the role of a product manager.

---

> Hands down, the Advanced Scrum Master Class was awesome and armed me with what I needed to be a better Scrum Master and Coach.

---

**Jeanette Ward** — *President & CEO, Texas Mutual*

> I don't think we could have done the transformation without Agile Velocity's coaching and training. Change is hard. [In a transformation,]... people are really excited about the change at first, and then the realities of change start to set in and then people want to gravitate back to the old ways of doing things.

---

**Nicole Tanzillo** — *COO & Co-Founder*

> Those of you considering partnering with a vendor, there are two things that made me really glad we did. It helped to have somebody that could see the blind spots that we couldn't see. We were so in it, we didn't know what we didn't know–both at a day-to-day implementation and at a leadership level. The other thing is something that I learned in this process that is applied to a lot of different areas: it matters who the message is coming from. For me, finding those experts–whether they were internal or external–to help me champion it was a really big deal.

---

**Katie Morris** — *Managing Director, Technology Southwest Airlines*

> At the Executive level, Agile Velocity was key in turning around our transformation focus and propelling it forward.

---

**Marty Garza** — *Vice President, Air Operations Technology for Southwest Airlines*

> I believe we are getting Better, Faster, and More Efficient in the Crew area. Due to a change in airline demand, the Crew department faced a massive schedule change. The team collaborated with the business on a potential solution. Using the new capabilities acquired during the transformation, we were able to develop an application that handled large scale schedule changes and the solution was built and deployed into production in 3 weeks. Prior to the transformation, this effort would have taken months to complete. We were able to save the company over $5 million dollars in the first two months.

---

**Ron Dovich** — *AVP of Technology at AT&T Cybersecurity*

> [Our Agile transformation] re-energized me. You can do these jobs for years and get good at it, but am I really being strategic? This will make you question what you are getting done and what your priorities are.

---

**Nicole Tanzillo** — *COO & Co-Founder Ceresa*

> It's not just about us. Lebron has a coach. The US Women's Soccer Team has a coach. These are world class people doing world class things, and they still have coaches because none of us can see the blind spots. Having someone who is objective both for us as leadership and for your team is important.

---

**Amy Green-Hinojosa** — *Vice President of Enterprise Program Management, Texas Mutual Insurance Company*

> To have someone come in and tell us, "You're good, but you're not as good as you think, and here's where you need to focus," was so powerful. We would have missed the mark completely if we had not had someone there to help us through those things.

---

**Brian Bernstein** — *Head of Technology Strategy, Finance, Business Management, and Transformation at Lennar*

> We were struggling to identify and focus on the right priorities, and our transformation management tool options had previously been relegated to spreadsheets and other piecemeal approaches. Now we're able to engage teams and stakeholders in assessments that are consistent and paint a clear roadmap of our transformation at all levels of the organization.
